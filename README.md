# PDF-Data-Extractor
This project is a Flask-based web application that extracts structured data from PDF documents using the OpenAI GPT-4 model. The application converts PDF pages to images, sends the images to the GPT-4 model along with a prompt, and returns the extracted information in JSON format.
